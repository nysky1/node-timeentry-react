<h1>Volunteer Track</h1>
<p>
"VolunteerTrack" is designed to simplify tracking volunteer hours for institutions.  Many schools mandate that parents volunteer for a required number of hours per year. Parents and staff are still doing this tracking on paper or within the Office suite.  VolunteerTrack moves the management of these vital hours to a web-based service and provides an administrator with the ability to verify and confirm activity hours.
